      title: Openai Assistants API
      description: >-
        The OpenAI Assistants API allows you to build AI assistants within your
        own applications. An Assistant has instructions and can leverage models,
        tools, and knowledge to respond to user queries. The Assistants API
        currently supports three types of tools: Code Interpreter, Retrieval,
        and Function calling.

      title: Openai Audio API
      description: >-
        The OpenAI Audio API provides endpoints for converting audio to text
        (transcription and translation) and text to audio (speech synthesis).
        Use the Whisper model for transcription and translation, and the TTS
        models for generating natural-sounding speech from text.

      title: Openai Chat Completions API
      description: >-
        The OpenAI Chat Completions API enables conversational AI by processing
        a list of messages comprising a conversation and returning a
        model-generated response. Supports various features including streaming,
        function calling, vision (image input), and JSON mode.

    - aid: openai-sandbox
      title: Openai Completions API
      description: >-
        The OpenAI Completions API provides legacy text completion capabilities.
        Given a prompt, the model will return one or more predicted completions
        along with the probabilities of alternative tokens at each position.
        Note: Most developers should use the Chat Completions API for newer
        models and better results.

      title: Openai Embeddings API
      description: >-
        The OpenAI Embeddings API provides vector representations of text inputs
        that can be easily consumed by machine learning models and algorithms.
        Embeddings are useful for semantic search, clustering, recommendations,
        anomaly detection, and classification tasks.

      title: Openai Files API
      description: >-
        The Files API allows you to upload, list, retrieve, and delete files
        that can be used with various OpenAI features such as Fine-tuning and
        Assistants.Files are used to upload documents that can be processed by
        OpenAI's models. The API supports various file formats and purposes
        including training data for fine-tuning and documents for the Assistants
        API.

      title: Openai Fine Tuning API
      description: >-
        The Fine-Tuning API allows you to customize OpenAI models by training
        them on your specific dataset. Fine-tuning lets you create specialized
        models tailored to your use case by providing training examples. You can
        create fine-tuning jobs, monitor their progress, list events, and manage
        completed fine-tuned models.Related guide: [Fine-tune

      description: >-
        The Images API allows you to generate, edit, and create variations of
        images using OpenAI's DALL·E models.With this API, you can create
        original images from text descriptions (prompts), edit existing images
        by providing a mask and instructions, or generate variations of existing
        images.Related guide: [Image

      title: Openai Models API
      description: >-
        The Models API allows you to list and describe the various AI models
        available in the OpenAI API.You can retrieve information about specific
        models, list all available models, and delete fine-tuned models that you
        have created. Each model has different capabilities, performance
        characteristics, and pricing.Related guide: [Models

      title: Openai Threads API
      description: >-
        The Threads API enables you to create and manage conversation threads
        for the Assistants feature.Threads contain messages that can be
        processed by assistants. You can create threads, add messages to them,
        run assistants against them, and retrieve the results. This API is part
        of the Assistants beta feature.Related guide: [Assistants

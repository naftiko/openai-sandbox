      name: Openai Assistants API
      description: >-
        The OpenAI Assistants API allows you to build AI assistants within your
        own applications. An Assistant has instructions and can leverage models,
        tools, and knowledge to respond to user queries. The Assistants API
        currently supports three types of tools: Code Interpreter, Retrieval,
        and Function calling.

        The OpenAI Chat Completions API enables conversational AI by processing
        a list of messages comprising a conversation and returning a
        model-generated response. Supports various features including streaming,
        function calling, vision (image input), and JSON mode.

        The OpenAI Completions API provides legacy text completion capabilities.
        Given a prompt, the model will return one or more predicted completions
        along with the probabilities of alternative tokens at each position.
        Note: Most developers should use the Chat Completions API for newer
        models and better results.

        them on your specific dataset. Fine-tuning lets you create specialized
        models tailored to your use case by providing training examples. You can
        create fine-tuning jobs, monitor their progress, list events, and manage
        completed fine-tuned models.
